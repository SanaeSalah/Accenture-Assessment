# Documentation of how to run the application:
1. Run the main class (ReadCSV)
2. If you want the runways for each airport enter a valid country name or country code.
   For example: NL or Netherlands
4. If you want the TOP 10 countries with the highest numbers or airports enter top 10.
   You will get a list op top 10 countries with highest numbers or airports, see countingRunways
   If you put an invalid country name or country code it will give you :"The entered country code en country name is invalid or TOP 10 is not well written!"
